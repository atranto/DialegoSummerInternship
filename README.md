# Dialego Summer Internship

In the 2.5-month summer internship in 2017, several company datasets were examined and analyzed. The goal was to identify interesting patterns and relationships between different key performance indicators (KPIs) used in past market research projects.

One such dataset is the Dialego Benchmark dataset. In this dataset, there are 12 KPIs, such as Brand Fit and Uniqueness, corresponding to several brands in various markets. The statistics for these KPIs were first aggregated in the preprocessing stage. In the analysis stage, certain tasks such as performing an exploratory analysis and applying machine learning models were carried out. The Python code for this stage is available in this repository.

Due to confidentiality, the original dataset is not disclosed. For more information regarding the Benchmark data, please contact Dialego AG, Germany.
